# Mysterium_Text_Adventure
A short text adventure demo game made in Godot loosely based on Mysterium

Instructions to View or Modify Code:
1) Download Godot Editor: https://godotengine.org/
2) Cloen repository onto local machine
3) Open Godot Editor, select Import, and navigate to Mysterium

To Run Game:
A .exe binary is included root folder the project (Mysterium_Text_Adventure/Mysterium). If you are on Windows, running this executable *should* run the game

If the binary does not run or if you are not on windows:
1) Follow instructions above to view or modify code
2) In the Godot Editor, in the toolbar click project->export->add and then choose the target platform you are running on. It will create a playable binary.
NOTE: Demo was developed and tested on Windows. It's reasonable to assume it works on most desktop environments, but it was not designed for mobile platforms
so it's unclear whether or not the game will play on Andoid/Iphone/etc. devices.

How To Play:
Follow the story via text, until you are prompted to make investigations.
In each investigation level, you are trying to pick the correct 
murderer, location, or weapon from 6 possible visual options.
Click a button corresponding to an investigation and use the results to
determine the appropriate choice.
The game randomly select a murderer, weapon, and location each time you play
so the solution will change between playthroughs.

Version 1.0: This is a roguh draft of the game. Mysterium Text Adventure is in a fully playable state, but some features like a title screen, transitions between levels,
and background music are not present.
